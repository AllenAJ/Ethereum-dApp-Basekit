# Ethereum-dApp-Basekit

## Project Setup
The accompanying video footage for this portion of the tutorial begins at 8:40. First, make sure you installed all of your dependencies from the previous section.

Let's get started building our app quickly! Instead of setting up the project manually, we're going to use my starter kit. Create your project by cloning the starter kit like this:

#### ' $ git clone https://github.com/AllenAJ/Ethereum-dApp-Basekit project '
Now, enter into the directory you just cloned like this:

#### ' $ cd project '
ðŸŽ‰ Viola!
